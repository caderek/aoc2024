In the endless corridor in front of the Easter Bunny Headquarters bathroom...
...a swarm of robots patrolled the area.
But there was one robot that was not like the others.
It was glowing!
Other robots made fun of it...
..."Did you eat a lanternfish or something?"
But once every 10,403 seconds...
...it was its time to...
SHINE!
